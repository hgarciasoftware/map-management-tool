# map-management-tool

https://hgarciasoftware.github.io/map-management-tool/

The Map Management Tool provides organizations and users belonging to said organization a way to visualize where everyone is geographically.

This project uses [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and React to render the client and Spring Boot, a Java framework, and MySQL to run the API server and the database.

### while making this app i learned:

- how to deploy a spring boot application on heroku

- a little about firebase and spring security

### and i got more practice with:

- bootstrap

- using react with third-party components

### there's a lot that could still be done:

- adding more input fields and displaying more data than just a map

- implementing spring security to ensure unprivileged users cannot access the admin route nor easily submit the homepage form more than once

- add more custom design
